# A Whisker in Time

This project generates a narrated video that combines AI-generated images in the style of Wassily Kandinsky with an AI-generated voiceover. The story follows Eleanor, a watchmaker, and her peculiar cat Chronos, as they experience a magical journey through time. The images are generated using OpenAI's DALL-E API, and the narration is synthesized using Google Cloud's Text-to-Speech API.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have the following:

- Python 3.6 or higher installed
- `google-cloud-texttospeech` library installed (`pip install google-cloud-texttospeech`)
- `moviepy` library installed (`pip install moviepy`)
- `requests` library installed (`pip install requests`)
- `Pillow` library installed (`pip install Pillow`)
- A Google Cloud account with Text-to-Speech API enabled and a JSON key file for authentication
- An OpenAI API key for using DALL-E API

## Running the script

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the `whisker_in_time` folder.
2. Open the `whisker_in_time.py` file and replace `[/PATH/TO/YOUR/CREDENTIALS.json]` with the path to your Google Cloud JSON key file and `[YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY]` with your OpenAI API key.
3. Save the changes and run the script using the command `python whisker_in_time.py`.
4. The script will generate a series of images and an audio narration, and it will then combine them into a video. The output files will be saved in the same folder with timestamped names.

## Customization

You can easily modify the story by editing the `prompt_list` variable in the script. Each element of the list corresponds to a scene in the story. The first set of prompts is used for Google Text-to-Speech to generate the narrative, while the second set is used for DALL-E to generate the images.


To generate the narrative text, you can utilize ChatGPT (Model: GPT-4) and ask it to produce a story based on your ideas. Once you have the narrative, you can then request ChatGPT to parse the text and provide prompts suitable for DALL-E.

There are many different voices to choose from when using Google Text-to-Speech. You can find a list of available voices at [Google Cloud Text-to-Speech Wavenet](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/wavenet). To set up Google credentialing and get assistance with other configurations, you can use GPT-4 to guide you through the process.

On line 104 of the script, you'll find the following code, which controls the style and content of the images generated by DALL-E:

```python
"prompt": f"Depicting a scene of Eleanor the watchmaker and/or her cat, in the style Wassily Kandinsky: {prompt}",
```
Feel free to experiment with your own prompts and the DALL-E settings to create unique stories and visuals. Don't forget to share your creations with us!
