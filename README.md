## 🌟 Introduction

This repository contains a diverse array of prompt engineering experiments, crafted with enthusiasm and a beginner's curiosity. By delving into these pages, you will gain a deeper understanding of the enigmatic world of AI, empowering you to hone your creative skills. Fear not, newcomers, as the knowledge offered here is accessible to all who seek it, regardless of expertise.

## 🔍 Experiments

In an ongoing effort to improve the learning experience, I have started including prompts within the .txt and .md files. For .py files and .mp4 output files, you will find a dedicated README file with the necessary prompts and explanations. The experiments are organized into three categories:

1. GPT_NONFICT 🌐
2. GPT_FICTION 🕊️
3. MISC 🔮
4. PY_SCRIPTS 🌿

This new approach ensures that you can fully appreciate the context and intent behind each experiment, enabling you to learn more effectively.
