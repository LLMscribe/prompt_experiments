This file will be updated with example prompts and outputs detailing requests for ChatGPT-4 to go back and recursively flesh out a text. You might wonder if you could just ask for more details directly. ¯\(ツ)/¯ You probably could -- I've had success with asking for more concrete, specific details. But who doesn't love a little fractal-like linguistic exploration?

## The Nutritionist's Plan (11 April 2023)

**PROMPT:**

I'd like to perform a creative-hypothetical exercise where you play an expert nutritionist. Please note that I realize that you're not a doctor or healthcare or nutritionist. I'm consulting with a full team of healthcare professionals. But we all want to see what GPT-4 can do as an expert nutritionist. So, first, take a look at this questionnaire and my answers, {[filled-out nutritionist intake questionnaire]}, and I want you to respond from the POV of an expert nutritionist. Your first task is to determine your first task.

**GPT-4:**

As an expert nutritionist, my first task is to evaluate the information you've provided in order to create a personalized nutritional plan that addresses your specific needs, preferences, and goals. Based on your responses, I will identify areas for improvement and make recommendations to help you achieve optimal cognitive functioning, strength building, mood balance, and longevity. Here is a summary of the key points and initial recommendations:

    Meal structure: It seems that you naturally prefer having two main meals with smaller snack-meals throughout the day. This can work well for some people, as long as you're ensuring that you're getting enough nutrients and calories throughout the day. Consider incorporating more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains into your snacks to boost your nutrient intake.

    Protein sources: Since soy products may cause mild discomfort, it's important to focus on alternative protein sources. You already consume eggs, chicken, and roast beef, which are good sources of protein. To add variety, consider incorporating other lean meats, fish, dairy, legumes, nuts, and seeds.

    Greens and fruits: While your green drink powder provides a wide range of nutrients, it's still important to consume whole fruits and vegetables. Try incorporating leafy greens like spinach, kale, or collard greens into your meals, either in salads or cooked dishes. Experiment with different fruits, such as apples, oranges, or grapes, to find ones you enjoy.

    Omega-3 fatty acids: You mentioned taking omega-3 fish oil supplements, which is great for supporting cognitive function and mood. Aim to include more fatty fish like salmon, mackerel, or sardines in your diet at least twice a week to further enhance your omega-3 intake.

    Hydration: Ensure you are drinking enough water throughout the day, as proper hydration is essential for overall health, cognitive function, and mood.

    Physical activity: While a 30-minute walk is a good start, consider incorporating more physical activity into your daily routine to support mood, cognitive function, and strength building. Try activities like yoga, strength training, or swimming, depending on your preferences and abilities.

    Sleep: Aim to get 7-9 hours of sleep per night, as adequate sleep is crucial for cognitive function, mood regulation, and overall health.

    Performance or fitness goals: Setting specific goals related to physical activity can help motivate you to maintain or improve your fitness level. These goals can be tailored to your preferences and abilities, such as increasing the duration of your walks, learning a new sport, or improving your strength through resistance training.

    Mental health and diet: To further support your mental health, focus on consuming a balanced diet rich in whole foods, including plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein sources, and healthy fats. Some nutrients, such as B vitamins, magnesium, and zinc, play crucial roles in mood regulation and cognitive function, so make sure you're getting sufficient amounts through your diet or supplements.

    Consistency and flexibility: Finally, remember that consistency is key in maintaining a healthy diet. It's normal to have occasional indulgences, but aim to make nutritious choices the majority of the time. Be open to trying new foods and recipes to keep things interesting and to discover new favorites.

These are initial recommendations based on the information you've provided. It's essential to consult with your healthcare professionals to ensure any changes to your diet or lifestyle are appropriate for your specific needs and medical history.

### The Request for More Details

**PROMPT:**

Great. I'd like you to go back and add a couple of levels of recursive detail throughout the text.

**GPT-4**

I understand that you'd like more detailed recommendations. Here are additional, more specific suggestions to address each key point mentioned earlier:

    Meal structure:
        Breakfast: Try adding vegetables to your scrambled eggs, such as spinach, tomatoes, or bell peppers.
        Snacks: Incorporate more nutrient-dense options like sliced veggies with hummus, whole-grain crackers with cheese or almond butter, or a small smoothie with fruits, greens, and Greek yogurt.

    Protein sources:
        Lean meats: Add turkey or lean pork to your meal rotation for variety.
        Fish: Incorporate fatty fish like salmon or tuna at least twice a week.
        Plant-based proteins: Experiment with legumes such as lentils, chickpeas, or black beans in salads, soups, or stews.

    Greens and fruits:
        Greens: Mix leafy greens into your scrambled eggs, add them to sandwiches, or use them as a base for salads.
        Fruits: Try adding sliced fruit to yogurt or oatmeal, blending them into smoothies, or enjoying them as a snack with a small handful of nuts.

    Omega-3 fatty acids:
        In addition to fish, include plant-based sources of omega-3s like walnuts, chia seeds, and flaxseeds in your diet.

    Hydration:
        Aim for at least 8-10 cups of water per day. Keep a water bottle with you and set reminders to drink regularly.

    Physical activity:
        Gradually increase your daily walk to 45-60 minutes or break it into two shorter sessions.
        Try incorporating bodyweight exercises like push-ups, squats, or lunges at home.
        Explore online resources or local classes for yoga, Pilates, or other activities that interest you.

    Sleep:
        Create a consistent sleep schedule, going to bed and waking up at the same time each day.
        Develop a relaxing bedtime routine, such as reading or taking a warm bath.
        Limit exposure to screens and electronic devices at least one hour before bedtime.

    Performance or fitness goals:
        Set specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals, such as increasing your daily walk to 60 minutes within two months or being able to complete 10 push-ups within six weeks.

    Mental health and diet:
        Include foods rich in B vitamins, such as whole grains, leafy greens, and lean meats.
        Consume magnesium-rich foods like almonds, spinach, or avocados.
        Add zinc-rich foods to your diet, such as oysters, beef, or pumpkin seeds.

    Consistency and flexibility:
        Plan your meals and snacks in advance to ensure you have healthy options readily available.
        Try new recipes or cooking techniques to expand your culinary repertoire and make healthy eating more enjoyable.
        Be patient with yourself and remember that progress takes time. Focus on making small, sustainable changes to your diet and lifestyle, and celebrate your successes along the way.

Remember to consult with your healthcare professionals before making any significant changes to your diet or lifestyle to ensure they align with your specific needs and medical history.
