The storm had been relentless, the raindrops hurling themselves against the ancient oak walls of the manor as if demanding entry. The wind howled, an unnerving symphony that seemed to contain whispers from the past. In the depths of the library, Leocadia sat in the shadows, her nimble fingers tracing over the spines of the leather-bound tomes. The flickering candlelight cast eerie shapes on the books, the tales they contained dancing like ghosts in the dimly lit room.

She glanced over at the towering figure of Matthias, his silver hair catching the light, creating an ethereal halo around his head. He was reading a fragile-looking parchment, his eyes narrowed as he attempted to decipher the archaic script.

"Leocadia, do you see this?" He pointed at a line on the parchment, his voice barely audible above the storm.

Her eyes followed the trajectory of his finger. "The prophecy of Umberto," she breathed. "It's said to foreshadow the fates of those whose lives are entwined with this place."

Matthias leaned closer, whispering, "Can you see how the words twist and change? The ink seems to be alive, shimmering like an oil slick upon the water."

Leocadia's heart quickened. She could sense the malicious energy emanating from the parchment, like tendrils of smoke seeking to ensnare them. Her eyes met Matthias', her fear mirrored in his steel-gray gaze.

A crash reverberated through the manor, echoing in the library. Leocadia flinched, feeling the darkness encroach upon them. As if drawn by an unseen force, the door creaked open, revealing Millicent—her normally vibrant red hair now damp and matted to her pale face.

"Leocadia! Matthias! I think... I think I saw something in the garden." Her voice quivered as she spoke, her eyes wide with terror.

"What was it, Millicent?" Leocadia's voice was steady, though her heart pounded like a drum in her chest.

Millicent hesitated. "I... I can't be sure. It was just a glimpse—a shadow moving among the hedges. But it felt... malevolent."

The candlelight wavered as the wind grew stronger, the storm's presence tangible in the room. Matthias clutched the parchment, a shiver running down his spine. "We must confront this darkness, whatever it may be."

Leocadia nodded, her resolve solidifying. "Together," she whispered, grasping Millicent's hand.

The trio ventured into the storm, rain lashing against their faces as they approached the garden. The wind seemed to tug at their very souls, seeking to tear them apart. They pressed on, drawn by a force they could not comprehend.

Among the hedges, they found a statue—an angel with a broken wing, its face twisted in agony. As they stared, the stone began to crack, the sound like bones breaking. The statue's face contorted into a sinister grin, its eyes boring into their souls.

A guttural laugh filled the air, sending a shiver through their hearts. The angel's mouth opened, and in a voice like gravel, it spoke.

"You have come... to your doom."

The ground beneath them began to tremble, the earth shifting as though alive. The trio grasped one another, terror threatening to consume them. The statue's laugh echoed through the storm, a promise of darkness to come.

And with that, the world plunged into chaos.
