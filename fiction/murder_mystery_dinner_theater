## Plot
----

### Act 1: The Gathering

The Crimson Carnival has come to town, and as night falls, Madame Rosaline invites her guests and performers to a grand feast under the main tent. The atmosphere is electric and filled with anticipation. Unbeknownst to the guests, tensions have been brewing among the performers due to hidden secrets and rivalries.

During the first course, Madame Rosaline proposes a toast to the success of the Crimson Carnival, while subtly dropping hints about the financial troubles the carnival has been facing. This plants the first seeds of suspicion in the guests' minds and adds a sense of urgency to the performers' actions.

Sebastian LeBlanc performs a captivating magic show, capturing the audience's attention and further immersing them in the world of the Crimson Carnival. However, Lucian Beaumont, the fortune teller, interrupts the show with a cryptic prophecy: "Tonight, blood will be shed, and the carousel will claim a soul."

This ominous warning casts a shadow over the evening, evoking a sense of unease and foreboding among the participants. Guests are encouraged to explore the Sideshow and Fortune Teller's Corner during a short intermission, where they can uncover hidden clues and gather more information about the performers.

### Act 2: The Murder

As the guests return to the dining area, they find the carousel horse centerpiece missing from the table. In its place, a bloodstained dagger has been ominously placed, leaving everyone in shock and confusion.

Madame Rosaline, clearly agitated, orders Viktor Petrov to find the carousel horse and investigate the dagger's appearance. Meanwhile, the dinner continues, with each character revealing a bit more about their secrets and motives, further entangling the web of intrigue.

Suddenly, a blood-curdling scream is heard from outside the tent. The guests and performers rush to the carousel, where they find the lifeless body of Celeste Dubois, the aerialist, impaled on the pole of the missing carousel horse. The carousel starts turning slowly, casting eerie shadows on her lifeless body, as the guests realize that the prophecy has come true.

The shock and horror of the murder plunge the carnival into chaos. Accusations and suspicions run rampant among the guests and performers, and alliances begin to form as they try to solve the murder.

### Act 3: The Investigation

With the authorities unable to reach the remote carnival location until morning, the guests and performers take it upon themselves to uncover the murderer. Lucian Beaumont, the fortune teller, guides the investigation by offering tarot card readings to the guests, each card corresponding to a character and hinting at their possible involvement in the murder.

The guests learn that Celeste was involved in a love triangle with Sebastian and Isabella, leading to a motive for jealousy and revenge. Additionally, they uncover the smuggling operation led by Viktor, as well as the financial troubles faced by Madame Rosaline and Ophelia.

Hugo and Esme√©, the conjoined twins, reveal the hidden passage they discovered, which leads to a treasure trove of stolen goods. Among these items, the guests find an old journal belonging to Jasper, the carousel operator. In it, they learn of his blackmailing schemes and that he had overheard Celeste planning to expose him.

The investigation reaches its climax as the guests are invited to cast their votes on the murderer's identity. The majority of the guests suspect Jasper, as the evidence seems to point directly at him. However, a select few guests, who have paid close attention to the hints and clues, suspect the true culprit: Ophelia Lovelace, the Bearded Lady.

Act 4: The Reveal

As the votes are tallied, Madame Rosaline announces Jasper as the prime suspect. Just as he's about to be apprehended, a guest with a keen eye for detail steps forward and reveals their suspicion of Ophelia.

The guest points out that Ophelia had both the motive and opportunity to commit the crime. They reveal that Celeste had discovered Ophelia's secret relationship with Madame Rosaline, as well as her funneling money to help the carnival. Celeste had threatened to expose this secret, which would have jeopardized the carnival's future and Ophelia's relationship with her sister.

The guest also notes that the dagger used in the murder was a prop from Ophelia's sideshow act, and Ophelia's familiarity with the carousel allowed her to plant Celeste's body in such a dramatic fashion. The campy and theatrical nature of the crime reflects Ophelia's own flair for the dramatic.

Confronted with the evidence, Ophelia tearfully confesses to the murder, admitting that she did it to protect her sister and the carnival. She pleads for understanding, as she only wanted to preserve her newfound family and the life she had built at the Crimson Carnival.

As the night comes to an end and the authorities arrive, the guests and performers are left to grapple with the tragic events and the revelation of the murderer. The experience leaves them with a bittersweet taste, as they have not only solved the mystery but also witnessed the downfall of a once-thriving carnival family.

In "The Crimson Carnival: The Specter of the Carousel," the participants are taken on a thrilling, suspenseful, and emotionally charged journey. The murder mystery dinner offers an immersive experience that expertly combines campy aesthetics with a complex, interwoven plot, keeping guests guessing until the very end.
