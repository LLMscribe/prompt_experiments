Is rapeseed oil ok in oat milk? I keep hearing claims that itâ€™s toxic


### GPT-4:
Rapeseed oil, also known as canola oil, is a common ingredient in many food products, including some oat milk brands. It is derived from the seeds of the rapeseed plant (Brassica napus) and is used as a source of healthy fats.

There have been concerns about the toxicity of rapeseed oil, particularly around the presence of erucic acid, which can be harmful in large quantities. However, modern canola oil is made from varieties of rapeseed that have been bred to contain low levels of erucic acid (less than 2%). This makes it safe for consumption, and it is generally recognized as safe by regulatory authorities like the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA).

Rapeseed oil is rich in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, particularly omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, which are essential for maintaining good health. It also has a high smoke point, making it suitable for cooking at high temperatures.

In oat milk, rapeseed oil is used to add creaminess and improve the mouthfeel of the product. It is generally safe for consumption, but if you have concerns or specific dietary needs, you can look for oat milk brands that do not contain rapeseed oil or choose to make your own oat milk at home without it.

Ok so how much oat milk would I have to drink to get a harmful quantity of erucic acid?


### GPT-4:
It is highly unlikely that you would consume a harmful amount of erucic acid from drinking oat milk containing rapeseed oil. As mentioned earlier, modern canola oil is made from varieties of rapeseed that have been bred to contain low levels of erucic acid (less than 2%). The regulatory authorities have set maximum limits for erucic acid content in food products to ensure their safety.

For instance, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has set a tolerable daily intake (TDI) for erucic acid at 7 milligrams per kilogram of body weight per day. To put this in perspective, a 70 kg (154 lb) person would have a TDI of 490 milligrams of erucic acid.

Since the amount of rapeseed oil in oat milk is relatively small, you would have to drink an unrealistically large amount of oat milk to approach the TDI for erucic acid. Even if you consume oat milk as part of your daily diet, the amount of erucic acid you would ingest would be well below the established safety limits.

That being said, it's always a good idea to maintain a balanced and varied diet. If you are still concerned about erucic acid or rapeseed oil, you can look for oat milk brands that do not contain rapeseed oil or make your own oat milk at home without it.

Ok but hypothetically how much oat milk?

### GPT-4: 
To provide a hypothetical estimate, we must make several assumptions about the oat milk and the person consuming it. Let's assume the following:

1. The oat milk contains rapeseed oil with the maximum allowed erucic acid content of 2%.
2. The rapeseed oil makes up 2% of the total volume of the oat milk (a high estimate, since the actual percentage is likely lower).
3. A person weighs 70 kg (154 lbs) and has a tolerable daily intake (TDI) for erucic acid of 490 milligrams, as calculated in the previous answer.

Under these assumptions, we can calculate the amount of erucic acid in 1 liter (1000 mL) of oat milk:

1000 mL (oat milk) * 0.02 (rapeseed oil percentage) * 0.02 (erucic acid percentage) = 0.4 mL of erucic acid

Since 1 mL of oil weighs approximately 0.92 grams, 0.4 mL of erucic acid would weigh around 0.368 grams or 368 milligrams.

Now, to reach the TDI of 490 milligrams of erucic acid for a 70 kg person, we can calculate the required volume of oat milk:

490 milligrams (TDI) / 368 milligrams (erucic acid per liter of oat milk) = 1.33 liters

Under these assumptions, a 70 kg person would need to consume approximately 1.33 liters of oat milk per day to reach the TDI for erucic acid.

It is important to note that these calculations are based on several assumptions and may not accurately reflect the actual amount of erucic acid in oat milk. In reality, the percentage of rapeseed oil and erucic acid content in oat milk is likely to be much lower, making the amount of oat milk one would need to consume to reach the TDI even larger.

Does oat milk with rapeseed oil impact your blood sugar?

### GPT-4: 
Oat milk with rapeseed oil can have an impact on blood sugar levels, but the effect is mostly due to the carbohydrates present in the oats rather than the rapeseed oil itself. Rapeseed oil, as a source of fat, has minimal impact on blood sugar levels. However, the carbohydrates in oats can raise blood sugar levels, especially if the oat milk contains added sugars or sweeteners.

Oats contain soluble fiber, particularly beta-glucan, which can help slow down the absorption of sugar in the bloodstream, resulting in a more gradual increase in blood sugar levels. However, the processing methods used to make oat milk can break down some of this soluble fiber, which may reduce its ability to moderate blood sugar spikes.

If you are concerned about the impact of oat milk on your blood sugar levels, consider the following tips:

1. Choose unsweetened oat milk: Opt for oat milk without added sugars or sweeteners to minimize the impact on blood sugar levels.
2. Check the label: Look for the carbohydrate and sugar content listed on the nutrition label to make an informed decision about the product's impact on blood sugar.
3. Consume oat milk in moderation: As with any food or beverage, consuming oat milk in moderation can help prevent significant blood sugar fluctuations.
4. Monitor your blood sugar: If you have diabetes or any condition requiring close monitoring of blood sugar levels, it is essential to track how different foods and beverages, including oat milk, affect your blood sugar levels and adjust your intake accordingly.

Remember that individual responses to food can vary, so it's important to pay attention to your body and consult your healthcare provider if you have concerns about how oat milk may affect your blood sugar levels.
