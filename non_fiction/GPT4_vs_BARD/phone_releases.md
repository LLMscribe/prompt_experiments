[_n.b. OpenAI is opening up their Web Browsing plugin to all ChatGPT Plus subscribers, but it seems that, although the Web Browsing model is listed under GPT-4, it is in fact a GPT-3 model_]

### The Prompt
Can you provide me with a table listing the main specs differences between the Google Pixel 6A and the newly released Pixel 7A?

Sure, here is a table listing the main specs differences between the Google Pixel 6A and the newly released Pixel 7A:
