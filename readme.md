# GPT-4 Portfolio

Welcome to my GPT-4 portfolio! This repository contains a collection of projects and experiments showcasing my work with the GPT-4 model by OpenAI. I am an IELTS teacher with an interest in prompt engineering, and I've used GPT-4 to create various content types, including text, markdown, mp4 videos, and Python scripts.

## Contents

This repository is organized into the following folders and files:

1. `fiction/`: Contains a murder mystery dinner show written with the help of GPT-4.
2. `non-fiction/`: Contains examples of GPT-4-generated content for a cannabis blog, including articles and an intro video.
3. `dalle-video-script/`: Contains a Python script that takes a narrative and visual prompts to generate a Dall-E generated video. Sample outputs are also included.
4. `iterative_interactions.md`: A markdown file demonstrating my iterative interactions with GPT-4, where I ask the AI model to add recursive details to a previous response.
5. `summarizations/`: (Coming soon) This folder will contain text summarizations done with a text refinement script plus BERT extractive summarizer, and post-processed with OpenAI's Davinci model.

In addition to the content in this repository, you can also find more videos generated using similar techniques on ([TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@chatgpt4_dreams)), ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/ChatGPT_dreams)), and ([Instagram](https://instagram.com/chatgpt_dreams)).

For more examples of my work, check out my Fiverr profile at [llmscribe](https://www.fiverr.com/llmscribe) and the "ShogScript" pseudocode repo on GitHub: [ShogScript](https://github.com/gitnomad24601/ShogScript), which has a couple of fun story-engine prompts in a proof-of-concept pseudocode for narrative-generation.

## Usage

To explore this repository, simply navigate to the folder or file you're interested in and view the content. You'll find a mix of text, markdown, mp4 videos, and Python scripts.

Please note that this repository is intended to showcase my work with GPT-4 and is not a tutorial on how to use the GPT-4 model itself. If you're interested in learning more about GPT-4, please refer to the [OpenAI website](https://www.openai.com/).
